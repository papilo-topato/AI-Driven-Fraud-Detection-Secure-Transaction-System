#h1 AI-Driven Fraud Detection & Secure Transaction System
An AI-powered system for real-time fraud detection and secure transactions. This project integrates deep learning models for biometric authentication (age and gender detection) and fraud detection, ensuring secure and seamless digital transactions.

#h2 Features
Real-Time Fraud Detection: AI models analyze transaction patterns to detect anomalies.

Biometric Authentication: Age and gender detection for secure KYC verification.

Secure Transactions: Encrypted transaction processing with fraud prevention mechanisms.

Cloud & Edge Optimized: Deployable on both cloud and edge devices.

Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js

Backend: Flask (Python)

AI Models: TensorFlow, OpenCV, scikit-learn

Database: SQLite

Real-Time Processing: WebSockets

Security: HTTPS, AES-256 encryption

Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Node.js 14+

TensorFlow 2.x

OpenCV 4.x

Steps
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-system.git
cd fraud-detection-system
Set Up Backend:

bash
Copy
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
Set Up Frontend:

bash
Copy
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm start
Access the Application:

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Usage
Transaction Processing:

Enter the transaction amount and recipient details.

Click "Process Transaction" to check for fraud.

Biometric Verification:

Allow access to your webcam.

Click "Verify" to detect age and gender.

Fraud Detection:

The system will flag suspicious transactions in real-time.
